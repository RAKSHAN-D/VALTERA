AICTE STUDENT ACTIVITY POINT PROGRAMME 
The AICTE Student Activity Point Programme (SAP) is an initiative introduced by the All-India Council 
for  Technical  Education  (AICTE) to  encourage  students  to  engage  in  extracurricular,  co-curricular,  and 
community  service  activities  alongside  their  academic  coursework.  This  program  aims  to  develop  well- 
rounded professionals by instilling leadership, teamwork, social responsibility, and ethical values in students. 
 
While  the  primary  goal  of  Student Activity  Point  Programme is  to  ensure  that  students  not  only  excel 
academically but also gain practical exposure to societal challenges. It encourages them to contribute to nation- 
building by participating in activities that enhance their personal and professional development. 
 
Benefits of the Programme 
• Enhances employability by developing soft skills, teamwork, and leadership qualities. 
• Encourages community engagement and a sense of social responsibility. 
• Provides hands-on practical exposure beyond classroom learning. 
• Helps in building a strong professional network through interactions in various events. 
 
Therefore, the AICTE Student Activity Point Programme ensures that graduates not only possess technical 
expertise but also emerge as responsible citizens capable of contributing meaningfully to society.

   Details of Activities Carried:- 
1. PLANTATION AT MANOVIKAS REHABILITATION CENTER  
 
       During my visit to Manovikas Rehabilitation Center for disabled people in Hubli, I had the opportunity to  
       contribute to a greener and more uplifting environment by planting flowers and plants within the premises.  
This initiative aimed to enhance the natural beauty of the center while also promoting a sense of peace and 
positivity among its residents. The presence of greenery is known to have therapeutic benefits,  improving  
air quality and fostering emotional well-being. Engaging in this activity allowed me to interact with the co- 
mmunity, understand their needs, and contribute to their happiness in a small yet meaningful way. Through 
       this act, I hope to inspire more people to support such institutions and take small steps towards making a po- 
       sitive social and environmental impact.

2.VISIT TO KELGERI LAKE FOR CLEANING CAMPAIGN 
 
As part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, we visited kelgeri lake in Dharwad and conducted a cleanliness drive  
to promote a healthier and cleaner environment. Our main focus was to actively participate in cleaning the 
village while also encouraging local residents to do the same. We began by surveying the area to identify place 
where waste had accumulated, such as roadsides, public spaces, and areas near houses. After dividing ourselves 
into groups, we systematically started collecting different types of waste, including plastic bags, discarded 
plastic water bottles, dry leaves, and other non-biodegradable materials. 
With  gloves  and  garbage  bags  in  hand,  we  worked  together  to  remove  litter  from  streets  and  open  areas, 
ensuring that waste was properly segregated for disposal. Plastic waste was collected separately to highlight 
the  importance  of  recycling  and  reducing  plastic  pollution.  Additionally,  we  cleared  dry  leaves  and  other 
organic waste to help keep the surroundings neat and prevent potential fire hazards. The collected waste was 
then disposed of in designated bins, and we also encouraged the residents to adopt proper waste management 
practices. Through this hands-on effort, we  aimed to set an example for the villagers and motivate  them to 
maintain  cleanliness  in  their  surroundings.  Beyond  just  picking  up  waste,  we  also  spoke  to  the  community 
about  the  long-term  benefits  of  cleanliness,  such  as  preventing  diseases  and  improving  overall  living 
conditions.  By  the  end  of  the  drive,  the  area  looked  significantly  cleaner,  and  there  was  a  strong  sense  of 
accomplishment among our team.

     3.VISIT TO LOCAL SCHOOL FOR DIGITAL AWARENESS 
As  part  of  our  initiative  to  promote  digital  awareness,  we  visited  a  local  school  in  Vivekananda  Nagar, 
Dharwad,  to  educate  students  about  digital  payments  and  the  importance  of  safe  online  transactions.  The 
session began with an introduction to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), where we explained how it works 
and its benefits in making quick and secure financial transactions. We then guided the students on the essential 
requirements for setting up a UPI-enabled account, such as linking their bank accounts with mobile numbers 
and using secure authentication methods like PINs and OTPs. 
To ensure they could confidently use digital payment systems, we provided a step-by-step demonstration on 
how  to  carry  out  UPI  transactions,  including  sending  and  receiving  money,  scanning  QR  codes,  and  using 
different UPI-based applications. Additionally, we focused on the critical aspect of online security by raising 
awareness  about  common  scams  related  to  digital  payments,  such  as  phishing,  fraudulent  calls,  and  fake 
payment requests. We advised them on best practices to stay safe, such as never sharing OTPs or PINs and 
verifying payment details before completing transactions. 
Through this session, we aimed to equip students with the knowledge and confidence to use digital payment 
systems responsibly. By spreading awareness about both the convenience and risks of online transactions.

4. FOOD DONATION AT MANOVIKAS CENTER  
 
     During my visit to Manovikas Rehabilitation Center for disabled people in Hubli, I had the opportunity to co- 
     ntribute in a meaningful way by planting flowers and plants to create a greener  more refreshing environment. 
     Additionally, to support the daily nutritional needs of the residents, I donated essential food supplies, includes 
     25kg of rice, 20kg of wheat flour, and 10kg of jaggery. While the plantation initiative aimed at fostering a cal- 
     ming and positive atmosphere, the food donation was a step toward ensuring sustenance and well-being for the 
     the individuals at the center. Through this initiative, I hoped to bring not only material support but also a sense  
     of care and compassion to the people residing there. This experience reinforced the importance of social  
     responsibility, and I hope to inspire others to contribute to such noble causes. 
        
       
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     5. BLOOD DONATION: 
As part of INSIGNIA'22, I participated in the blood donation campaign jointly organized by the NSS unit and 
the Red Cross unit of SDMCET. Understanding the importance of blood donation in saving lives, I willingly 
contributed to this noble cause. 
 
The event was well-organized, with proper medical supervision ensuring a safe and hygienic donation process. 
Before donating, a preliminary health check-up was conducted to assess eligibility, including checking blood 
pressure, haemoglobin levels, and overall health conditions. The medical team guided and assisted throughout 
the process, making it a smooth and comfortable experience. 
 
Blood donation is a vital act of service, as it helps patients in need, including accident victims, those undergoing 
surgeries, and individuals with critical illnesses. By donating blood, I felt a deep sense of fulfilment, knowing 
that my small contribution could make a significant difference in someone's life. The campaign also aimed to 
spread awareness about the importance of regular blood donation and encourage more students to participate. 
Many volunteers actively took part, creating a strong sense of community and social responsibility. 
 
Through this initiative, I realized how a simple act of kindness can have a profound impact on society. The 
experience reinforced the importance of giving back and contributing to the well-being of others. I hope that 
more people recognize the value of blood donation and come forward to support such meaningful causes in 
the future.

ACTIVITY OUTCOME:- 
Doing this AICTE activity was important because it helped me grow beyond academics and apply what I had 
learned in real life. It taught me teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving while also allowing me to make 
a difference in society. Whether it was helping students with their studies, spreading awareness about digital 
safety, or participating in a cleanliness drive, this experience shaped me into a more responsible and aware 
individual. It also gave me the opportunity to interact with different people, understand their challenges, and 
contribute in whatever way I could. More than just a requirement, this activity helped me develop empathy, a 
sense of responsibility, and the initiative to make a positive impact which are qualities that will stay with me 
long after college
